# Tokenized Government Grant Management

## Overview

This project implements a blockchain-based system for managing government grants through tokenization. By leveraging smart contracts, the platform provides transparency, accountability, and efficiency in the grant lifecycleâ€”from application to fund allocation to milestone tracking and final reporting.

## Key Components

### Applicant Verification Contract
- Validates the eligibility of potential grant recipients
- Stores applicant credentials and verification status
- Implements KYC (Know Your Customer) and due diligence processes
- Prevents duplicate applications across different grant programs
- Maintains privacy controls for sensitive applicant information

### Fund Allocation Contract
- Manages the distribution of approved grant funding
- Tokenizes grant amounts for transparent tracking
- Implements conditional release of funds based on milestone completion
- Provides real-time visibility into allocation status
- Supports multiple disbursement methods and schedules

### Milestone Tracking Contract
- Monitors progress against established grant objectives
- Records completion of project deliverables
- Implements multi-party verification of milestone achievements
- Triggers fund releases upon validated milestone completion
- Stores evidence submissions for accountability

### Reporting Compliance Contract
- Ensures proper documentation of grant outcomes
- Tracks reporting deadlines and submission status
- Validates compliance with grant requirements
- Stores immutable records of all submitted reports
- Generates audit trails for oversight purposes

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16.0+)
- Hardhat or Truffle development environment
- Ethereum-compatible wallet (MetaMask recommended)
- Access to test network (Goerli, Sepolia) or local blockchain

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tokenized-grant-management.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd tokenized-grant-management

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile smart contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Run tests
npx hardhat test

# Deploy to test network
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```

## Usage

The platform serves different stakeholders in the grant management process:

### For Grant Administrators
- Onboard and verify eligible applicants
- Configure grant programs and funding parameters
- Review and approve milestone completions
- Monitor overall program compliance and reporting

### For Grant Recipients
- Complete verification process
- Access allocated funds upon milestone completion
- Submit evidence of progress and completed deliverables
- Complete required reporting through the platform

### For Oversight Bodies
- Access real-time data on fund allocation and usage
- Review verification processes and recipient eligibility
- Monitor program outcomes and milestone completion rates
- Generate compliance reports for auditing purposes

## Security Considerations

- Multi-signature requirements for fund disbursements
- Encrypted storage of sensitive applicant information
- Regular security audits of smart contracts
- Role-based access controls across all platform features
